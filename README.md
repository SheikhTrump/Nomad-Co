NomadNest: Dependencies for My Traveler Profile Feature
This file lists the files I need from the authentication module to get my Traveler Profile feature working correctly.

1. models/user.py
Why I need it: This file defines how our user data is structured in the database. My profile page needs to read and write this data.

2. routes/auth.py
Why I need it: This handles the login, signup, and logout functionality. My profile page is protected and requires a user to be logged in.

3. templates/login.html
Why I need it: This is the UI for the login page.

4. templates/signup.html
Why I need it: This is the UI for creating a new account.

5. templates/dashboard.html
Reason: This is the main landing page after a user logs in. My profile page links back to it.

Note: I have updated this file to include the link that directs travelers to my profile page.

Summary: The user authentication system is the foundation that my profile feature is built on.
